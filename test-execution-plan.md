// This test validates the core requirement
test('P2P model migration control', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.click('[data-tab="models"]');
  const p2pCheckbox = page.locator('#p2pEnabled');
  
  // Should be enabled by default
  await expect(p2pCheckbox).toBeChecked();
  
  // Should be toggleable
  await p2pCheckbox.uncheck();
  await expect(p2pCheckbox).not.toBeChecked();
  
  // When enabled, should trigger migration behavior
  await p2pCheckbox.check();
  // ... validate migration controls become active
});
```

### Phase 5: Chat Interface Testing (8 tests)

**Real-time Communication**
```javascript
✓ Message input accepts text

```

### Phase 7: Error Handling & Recovery (6 tests)

**Resilience Testing**
```javascript
✓ Network disconnection handled gracefully
✓ Malformed API responses don't crash UI
✓ Error boundary catches JavaScript errors
✓ Rapid clicking doesn't break interface
✓ Invalid form inputs handled
✓ WebSocket reconnection works
```

### Phase 8: Performance Validation (4 tests)

curl http://localhost:13001/api/version # Worker 2
curl http://localhost:13002/api/version # Worker 3
```

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install @playwright/test

# Run specific test suites
npx playwright test tests/api-health-tests.js
npx playwright test tests/ui-interaction-tests.js
npx playwright test tests/p2p-model-migration-tests.js

# Run comprehensive suite
