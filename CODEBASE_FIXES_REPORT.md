# OllamaMax Codebase Improvements Report

## Overview
This report documents the systematic fixes and improvements made to the OllamaMax distributed AI platform codebase.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Package Declaration Consistency
**Issue**: Mixed package declarations causing compilation errors
- Fixed `distributed-fault-tolerance.go`, `distributed-load-balancer.go`, and `distributed-partitioning-strategies.go` to use consistent package declarations
- Standardized on `package main` for standalone executables

### 2. Type System Improvements
**Issue**: Inconsistent type definitions and missing fields
- Unified `Model` type to `ModelInfo` across all modules
- Added missing `Models` field to `NodeInfo` struct for model locality tracking
- Fixed null pointer dereferences by adding proper nil checks

### 3. Method Receiver Consistency
**Issue**: Methods defined with receivers that could be standalone functions
- Converted utility functions to standalone functions where appropriate
- Maintained encapsulation for stateful operations

### 4. Import Dependencies
**Issue**: Missing imports and dependency issues
- Added proper error handling imports
- Fixed Ollama API integration imports

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Load Balancing Algorithm Enhancements
- **Intelligent Selection**: Implemented ML-based node selection with feature scoring

## Security Enhancements

### 1. JWT Authentication System
- **RSA-256 Signature**: Secure token signing with asymmetric cryptography
- **Role-based Access Control**: Hierarchical permission system
- **Token Refresh**: Secure token renewal mechanism
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive authentication event tracking

### 2. Authorization Framework
- **Permission System**: Granular permission model for different operations
- **Role Definitions**: Pre-defined roles with appropriate permissions
- **Context-aware Checks**: Permission validation based on request context

## Architecture Improvements
