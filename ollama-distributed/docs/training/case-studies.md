Learn from successful Ollama Distributed deployments across different industries and use cases.

## Case Study 1: TechStartup - Scaling AI Product Development

### Company Profile
- **Industry**: AI-powered SaaS
- **Size**: 50 employees
- **Challenge**: Handle unpredictable traffic spikes for their AI writing assistant

### The Challenge

TechStartup's AI writing assistant experienced massive growth, going from 100 to 10,000+ daily active users in 6 months. Their single-node Ollama setup couldn't handle the load:
