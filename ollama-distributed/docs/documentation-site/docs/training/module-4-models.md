# Module 4: Model Management

**Duration**: 10 minutes  
**Objective**: Understand model operations, current capabilities, and distributed model architecture

Welcome to Module 4! Now you'll learn about model management in Ollama Distributed, understanding both current capabilities and the planned distributed model system.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this module, you will:
- ✅ Understand current model management capabilities
- ✅ Use model-related CLI commands
- ✅ Explore the distributed model architecture
- ✅ Learn about planned model distribution features
- ✅ Set realistic expectations for model operations

## 🤖 Current Model Management

### Step 1: Explore Model Commands

Let's see what model-related commands are available:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /home/kp/ollamamax

# Check proxy commands (model management)
./bin/ollama-distributed proxy --help
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🔗 Model management and proxy operations

Usage:
  ollama-distributed proxy [command]

Available Commands:
  pull        Download a model
  list        List available models

Use "ollama-distributed proxy [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

**✅ Checkpoint 1**: Model management commands are available via the proxy subcommand.

### Step 2: List Available Models

Let's see what models are currently available:

```bash
# List available models
./bin/ollama-distributed proxy list
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🤖 Available Models
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
phi3:mini       2.3GB    ✅ Ready
llama2:7b       3.8GB    ⏳ Downloading
codellama       3.8GB    💤 Available
```

**📝 Learning Points:**
- Models have different statuses: ✅ Ready, ⏳ Downloading, 💤 Available
- Size information is displayed
- This is currently a simulation of model management

**✅ Checkpoint 2**: Model list command works and shows structured information.

### Step 3: Try Model Download

Let's try downloading a model:

```bash
# Try to download a small model
./bin/ollama-distributed proxy pull phi3:mini
```

**Expected Output:**
```
📦 Downloading model: phi3:mini
This may take a few minutes depending on model size...

[==========] 100%
✅ Successfully pulled phi3:mini
```

**📝 Learning Point**: This simulates the download process. In the full implementation, this would actually download and distribute the model across cluster nodes.

**✅ Checkpoint 3**: Model pull command completes successfully (simulated).

## 🧪 Hands-On Exercise 1: Model API Interaction

Let's explore model management through the API:

```bash
# Check models via API
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/tags | jq .

# Try to show model details
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/show \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "phi3:mini"}' | jq .
```

**Expected Responses:**

**Models List:**
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "llama2:7b",
      "status": "available",
      "size": "3.8GB"
    },
    {
      "name": "phi3:mini", 
      "status": "ready",
      "size": "2.3GB"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Model Details:**
```json
{
  "name": "phi3:mini",
  "size": "2.3GB",
  "modified_at": "2025-08-28T01:30:00Z",
  "details": {
    "format": "gguf",
    "families": ["phi3"]
  }
}
```

**✅ Checkpoint 4**: Model API endpoints return structured model information.

### Step 4: Understanding Model Storage

Let's explore where models would be stored:

```bash
# Check the models directory
ls -la ~/.ollamamax/data/models/

# Check configuration for model storage
grep -A 5 "models:" ~/.ollamamax/quickstart-config.yaml
```

**Expected Configuration:**
```yaml
models:
  store_path: "/home/user/.ollamamax/data/models"
  auto_cleanup: true
```

**📝 Storage Architecture:**
- Models are stored in the configured data directory
- Auto-cleanup feature manages storage space
- Distributed storage will replicate models across nodes

**✅ Checkpoint 5**: Understanding of model storage configuration and location.

## 🌐 Distributed Model Architecture

### Step 5: Explore Distributed Model Features

Let's check what distributed model features are available:

```bash
# Check distributed models endpoint
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/distributed/models | jq .

# Check model replication status
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api/distributed/replication/status | jq .
```

**Expected Responses:**

**Distributed Models:**
```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "name": "llama2:7b",
      "replicas": 1,
      "nodes": ["node1"],
      "total_size": "3.8GB",
      "status": "ready"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Replication Status:**
```json
{
  "total_models": 2,
  "replicated_models": 0,
  "pending_replications": 0,
  "failed_replications": 0,
  "replication_health": "healthy"
}
```

**✅ Checkpoint 6**: Distributed model API endpoints show architectural framework.

### Step 6: Understanding Model Distribution Concepts

Let's explore the concepts behind distributed models:

```bash
# Check if we can trigger model rebalancing
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/distributed/rebalance | jq .

# Look at model migration concepts
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/distributed/migrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model_name": "phi3:mini", "from_node": "node1", "to_node": "node2"}' | jq .
```

**Expected Responses:**

**Rebalance:**
```json
{
  "message": "Rebalance initiated",
  "status": "started",
  "estimated_time": "5m"
}
```

**Migration:**
```json
{
  "message": "Migration initiated",
  "migration_id": "mig_123456",
  "status": "started"
}
```

**📝 Distributed Model Concepts:**
- **Replication**: Models copied to multiple nodes for availability
- **Rebalancing**: Automatic redistribution for optimal performance
- **Migration**: Moving models between nodes as needed
- **Load Balancing**: Routing requests to nodes with the model

**✅ Checkpoint 7**: Understanding of distributed model management concepts.

## 🧪 Hands-On Exercise 2: Model-Related Configuration

Let's explore model-related configuration options:

```bash
# Look at model configuration in detail
cat ~/.ollamamax/quickstart-config.yaml | grep -A 10 "models:"

# Check what model profiles are available in config generator
/home/kp/ollamamax/scripts/config-generator.sh --help | grep -A 5 "Available Profiles"
```

**Expected Configuration Sections:**
```yaml
models:
  store_path: "/home/user/.ollamamax/data/models"
  max_cache_size: "10GB"
  auto_cleanup: true
  download_timeout: "30m"
  concurrency: 3
```

**Available Profiles for Models:**
- **GPU Profile**: Optimized for GPU model loading
- **Edge Profile**: Lightweight profile for smaller models
- **Production Profile**: High-performance model management

**✅ Checkpoint 8**: Understanding model-specific configuration options.

```bash
# Check if Ollama integration tools exist
ls -la /home/kp/ollamamax/scripts/ollama-integration.sh

# Look at integration options
/home/kp/ollamamax/scripts/ollama-integration.sh --help
```

**Expected Integration Features:**
```
