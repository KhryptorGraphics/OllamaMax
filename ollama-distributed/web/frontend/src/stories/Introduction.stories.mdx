# OllamaMax Design System

Welcome to the **OllamaMax Design System** ‚Äì a comprehensive component library built for the distributed AI platform. This design system provides a unified visual language and consistent user experience across all OllamaMax applications.

## üéØ Design Principles

### Consistency
Every component follows unified patterns for spacing, typography, colors, and interactions. This ensures a cohesive experience regardless of where users encounter our interface.

### Accessibility
Built with accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought. All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and include:
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast color schemes
- Focus management

### Performance
Optimized for speed and efficiency with:
- Tree-shakable components
- Minimal bundle impact
- Lazy loading support
- Performance-first animations

### Flexibility
Designed to be adaptable to diverse use cases while maintaining consistency:
- Composable component architecture
- Extensive variant system
- Theme customization
- Responsive design patterns

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Component Structure
Our components are built using modern React patterns:
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Class Variance Authority (CVA)** for consistent styling
- **Forwardable refs** for composition
- **Compound components** for flexibility

### Design Tokens
Centralized design tokens for:
- Colors and themes
- Typography scales
- Spacing system
- Border radius
- Shadows and elevation
- Animations and transitions

### Responsive Design
Mobile-first approach with:
- Flexible grid systems
- Responsive typography
- Adaptive component layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions

## üì¶ Component Categories

### Primitives
Building blocks for all interfaces:
- **Button** - Actions and navigation
- **Input** - Form controls and data entry
- **Label** - Form labeling and descriptions

### Layout
Structure and organization:
- **Card** - Content containers
- **Layout** - Page and section structure
- **Grid** - Responsive layout systems

### Feedback
User communication:
- **Alert** - Messages and notifications
- **Badge** - Status indicators and labels
- **Toast** - Temporary notifications

### Navigation
Movement and wayfinding:
- **Navigation** - Site navigation
- **Breadcrumbs** - Hierarchical navigation
- **Pagination** - Content navigation

## üé® Visual Language

### Color System
Our color palette is designed for:
- **Semantic meaning** - Colors convey purpose and state

- **Dark mode support** - Consistent experience across themes
- **Brand alignment** - Reflecting OllamaMax identity

### Typography
Carefully crafted type scale for:
- **Hierarchy** - Clear information structure
- **Readability** - Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Performance** - Web-optimized font loading

### Spacing & Layout
Systematic approach to space:
- **8-point grid system** - Consistent rhythm
- **Flexible containers** - Responsive layouts
- **Logical grouping** - Related content proximity
