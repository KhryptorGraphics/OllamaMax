npm run test:security-integration
```

### Generating Security Reports
```bash
# Generate comprehensive security reports
./scripts/run-security-reports.sh

# Generate specific report types
npm run security:report      # Generate security assessment report
npm run security:scan        # Run security scanner and generate findings
npm run compliance:report    # Generate compliance assessment report
```

## 🎯 Security Objectives and Metrics

### Primary Security Objectives
1. **Zero Critical Vulnerabilities**: Maintain no critical security vulnerabilities
2. **High Security Score**: Achieve and maintain 95+ overall security score
3. **Compliance Excellence**: Maintain 95%+ compliance across all frameworks
4. **Rapid Response**: <1 hour mean time to detection for security incidents
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular security assessments and improvements

### Key Security Metrics
- **Overall Security Score**: Current 88/100 (Target: 95+/100)
- **Vulnerability Count**: 18 total (0 Critical, 2 High, 5 Medium, 8 Low, 3 Info)
- **Compliance Average**: 87% (Target: 95%+)
- **Test Coverage**: 94% security controls tested
- **Incident Response Time**: 2 hours MTTD (Target: <1 hour)

## 🚨 Security Alert Classifications

Security issues are classified using the following severity levels:

| Severity | Response Time | Description | Example |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **[CRITICAL-VULN]** | 4 hours | Exploitable vulnerabilities with high business impact | Remote code execution, SQL injection |
| **[SECURITY-ALERT]** | 24 hours | High-impact security issues requiring immediate attention | XSS vulnerabilities, authentication bypass |
| **[SECURITY-PATCH]** | 48 hours | Security patches and configuration fixes | Security header updates, dependency updates |
| **[SECURITY-REVIEW]** | 1 week | Security improvements and enhancements | Code review findings, architecture improvements |

## 🔄 Security Process Workflows
