# Phase 2: Distributed Scheduling Improvements - Summary

## Overview

In Phase 2, we've enhanced the distributed scheduling capabilities of the Ollama Distributed system with advanced partitioning strategies, improved load balancing, and enhanced fault tolerance mechanisms. These improvements focus on optimizing performance, improving scalability, and increasing system reliability.

## 1. Enhanced Partitioning Strategies

We've implemented four advanced partitioning strategies to improve distributed scheduling:

### 1.1 Pipeline Parallelism Strategy
- Divides models with many layers into sequential pipeline stages
- Assigns each stage to different nodes for parallel processing
- Optimized for models with many layers (>20)
- Significantly reduces overall inference time for deep models

### 1.2 Tensor Parallelism Strategy
- Splits large tensors across multiple nodes for parallel processing
- Works well for models with large context windows (>2048 tokens)
- Distributes computation within layers rather than across layers
- Best for large context lengths with high parallelizability

### 1.3 Hybrid Parallelism Strategy
- Combines pipeline and tensor parallelism
- Provides the benefits of both approaches for complex workloads
- Most effective for large models with both many layers and large context
- Offers optimal performance for extremely large models

### 1.4 Adaptive Partitioning Strategy
- Dynamically selects the best partitioning approach based on workload analysis
- Learns from performance to optimize future decisions
- Implements machine learning techniques to continuously improve
- Adjusts strategy weights based on historical performance

## 2. Enhanced Partition Manager

We've enhanced the partition manager with several improvements:

### 2.1 Performance Tracking
- Tracks execution time, success rate, and throughput for each strategy
- Maintains historical performance data for learning
- Implements exponential moving averages for smooth metrics
- Provides detailed metrics for optimization decisions

### 2.2 Adaptive Selection
- Dynamically adjusts strategy weights based on performance
- Implements learning algorithms to improve future decisions
- Selects the best strategy for each specific workload
- Offers hybrid approaches that combine multiple strategies

### 2.3 Strategy Metrics
- Provides detailed metrics for each strategy
- Tracks total executions, successes, failures, and performance
- Calculates average latencies and throughputs
- Updates strategy performance in real-time

### 2.4 Selection History
- Records selection history for analysis and debugging
- Maintains metrics for learning and optimization
- Keeps a rolling window of recent selections
- Implements pruning to prevent memory leaks
