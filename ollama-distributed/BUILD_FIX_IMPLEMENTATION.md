# Build Fix Implementation Plan

## üéØ Current Issue
The project has compilation issues that prevent successful builds. Go commands are hanging, suggesting dependency or environment issues.

## üìã Critical Issues Identified

Based on the existing documentation, the main issues are:

### 1. **Dependency Issues**
- Missing or incorrect import paths
- Circular dependencies between packages
- Ollama integration conflicts

### 2. **Type Conflicts**
- Inconsistent type definitions in fault tolerance system
- WebSocket type conflicts in API gateway
- Missing interface implementations

### 3. **Missing Implementations**
- Stub implementations that need completion
- Missing method implementations
- Incomplete interface definitions

## üîß Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Environment Verification
1. **Check Go Environment**
   - Verify Go version compatibility
   - Check GOPROXY and module settings
   - Verify network connectivity

### Phase 2: Dependency Resolution
1. **Fix Import Paths**
   - Update incorrect import paths
   - Resolve circular dependencies
   - Add missing dependencies

### Phase 3: Type System Fixes
1. **Fault Tolerance Types**
   - Fix type assertion issues
   - Standardize type definitions
   - Remove unused imports

2. **API Gateway Types**
   - Resolve WebSocket conflicts
   - Fix connection type mismatches
   - Complete missing implementations

### Phase 4: Build Verification
1. **Package-by-Package Testing**
   - Test core packages individually
   - Identify specific compilation errors
   - Fix issues incrementally

## üöÄ Immediate Actions

### 1. Create Minimal Working Version
Focus on getting the core CLI to build and work:
- Fix proxy package compilation
- Ensure cmd/node builds successfully
- Verify basic functionality

### 2. Implement Critical Fixes
Based on documentation:
- Add missing JWT dependency
- Fix WebSocket type conflicts
- Resolve import path issues

### 3. Stub Missing Implementations
For complex systems that aren't immediately needed:
- Create stub implementations for fault tolerance
- Provide minimal API gateway functionality
- Ensure compilation succeeds

## üìä Success Criteria

### Immediate Goals
- [ ] `go build ./cmd/node` succeeds
- [ ] `go build ./pkg/proxy` succeeds
- [ ] `go build ./pkg/config` succeeds

### Secondary Goals
- [ ] All core packages compile
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] CLI commands work

### Long-term Goals
- [ ] Full system integration
- [ ] Complete fault tolerance implementation
- [ ] Production-ready deployment

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Environment Check**: Verify Go environment and dependencies
2. **Targeted Fixes**: Implement specific fixes for documented issues
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test packages individually
4. **Integration Verification**: Ensure components work together

## üìù Implementation Notes

The goal is to get a working system that users can use immediately, rather than trying to fix every advanced feature at once. We'll focus on:

1. **Core Functionality**: CLI, proxy, basic distributed features
2. **User Experience**: Ensure documented features work
3. **Stability**: Reliable compilation and execution
4. **Extensibility**: Foundation for future enhancements

This approach ensures that the proxy CLI commands we've implemented and documented are actually usable by users, which is the most important immediate goal.
