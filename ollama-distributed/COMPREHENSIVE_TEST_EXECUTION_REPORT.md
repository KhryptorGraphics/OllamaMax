---

## ⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUES & ANALYSIS**

### 1. **Consensus Module** - **PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY**
**Status**: Most tests pass, but runtime issues remain

**Working Tests**:
- ✅ `TestEngine_NewEngine` (all subtests pass)
- ✅ `TestEngine_StartShutdown` 
- ✅ `TestFSM_Snapshot`
- ✅ `TestFSM_Restore`

**Issues**:
- ❌ **Channel panic**: `panic: send on closed channel` in FSM.Apply
- ❌ **Apply/Get functionality**: Values not persisting in consensus state
- 🔍 **Root cause**: Likely goroutine/channel lifecycle management issue

### 2. **Property-Based Tests** - **MINOR API ISSUES**
**Status**: Framework complete, minor API compatibility issues

**Issues**:
- ❌ `gen.TimeRange` API changes in gopter library
- ❌ Type assertion issues with interface{} types
- ❌ Missing methods in consensus Engine (GetCurrentTerm)

### 3. **P2P Module** - **STRUCTURAL ISSUES**
**Status**: Test framework exists but needs API alignment

**Issues**:
- ❌ Resource capabilities struct field mismatches (partially fixed)
- ❌ Some test methods may not exist in actual P2P implementation

### 4. **Additional Test Categories** - **DEPENDENCY ISSUES**
**Status**: Test frameworks complete but require working core modules

**Affected Categories**:
- ❌ **API Server Tests** - Depend on working scheduler/P2P integration
- ❌ **End-to-End Tests** - Require all components working together
- ❌ **Integration Tests** - Need core module stability
- ❌ **Chaos Engineering** - Require stable base system
- ❌ **Security Tests** - Need working API endpoints

## 🎯 **DETAILED TECHNICAL ANALYSIS**

### **Critical Finding: Channel Management Issue**
The most significant remaining issue is in the consensus module's FSM (Finite State Machine):

```go
// Location: pkg/consensus/engine.go:409
panic: send on closed channel
```

**Analysis**: The FSM.Apply method is attempting to send events to a channel that has been closed, likely due to:
1. Goroutine lifecycle management issues
2. Channel closure during shutdown not being properly coordinated
3. Concurrent access to channel state

### **Property-Based Testing API Issues**
Minor but fixable issues with the gopter library API:

```go
// Issue: Time handling in generators
gen.TimeRange(time.Now(), time.Now().Add(24 * time.Hour))
// Should be: duration values, not time.Time values
```

### **Resource Capabilities Struct Evolution**
The test framework assumed certain field names that have evolved:

```go
// Old structure (in tests)
type NodeCapabilities struct {
    CPU int
    ModelTypes []string
}

// Actual structure (in code)
type NodeCapabilities struct {
    CPUCores int
    SupportedModels []string
}
```
