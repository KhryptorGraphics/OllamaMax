   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, formal verification
   - **Contingency**: Use proven Raft library (etcd/raft)

3. **Performance Issues**
   - **Risk**: System doesn't meet performance targets
   - **Mitigation**: Early benchmarking, profiling
   - **Contingency**: Optimize critical paths, scale horizontally

#### Schedule Risks
1. **Dependency Delays**

   - **Mitigation**: Identify dependencies early, create mocks
   - **Contingency**: Parallel development with stubs

2. **Scope Creep**
   - **Risk**: Additional requirements added mid-development
   - **Mitigation**: Clear requirements, change control process
   - **Contingency**: Defer non-critical features to future releases

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Daily**: Team standup
- **Weekly**: Progress report to stakeholders
- **Bi-weekly**: Demo to product team
- **Monthly**: Executive summary

### Escalation Process
1. **Technical Issues**: Lead Developer → Architecture Team

3. **Resource Issues**: Engineering Manager → VP Engineering

### Documentation Requirements
- **Architecture Decisions**: ADR (Architecture Decision Records)
- **API Changes**: OpenAPI specifications
- **Deployment Changes**: Runbook updates
- **Security Changes**: Security review documentation

This workflow ensures systematic progress tracking, quality maintenance, and risk mitigation throughout the development process.
