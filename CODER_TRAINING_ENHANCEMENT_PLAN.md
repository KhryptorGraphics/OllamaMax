- Missing working model interaction examples
- No validation for distributed model operations

#### 2. Interactive Exercises - Need Expansion
- Limited hands-on coding exercises
- Missing progressive skill-building labs
- No certification-ready challenges

#### 3. Validation and Testing - Needs Integration
- Separate validation scripts need module integration
- Missing automated test harnesses for each module
- No progressive validation checkpoints
