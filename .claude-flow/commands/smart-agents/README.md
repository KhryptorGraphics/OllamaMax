## Integration with Claude Code

The smart-agents system seamlessly integrates with Claude Code's Task tool:

```javascript
// Automatic agent spawning with specialized prompts
const agents = await swarm.spawnAgents([
  'system-architect',
  'backend-architect', 
  'security-engineer',
  'performance-engineer'
]);

// Parallel execution with Claude Task tool
const results = await Promise.all(
  agents.map(agent => claudeTaskTool.execute(agent.prompt, {
    subagent_type: agent.specialization
  }))
);
```

## Neural Learning Features

### Pattern Recognition
- **Success Patterns**: Learns from successful task completions
- **Failure Analysis**: Analyzes and learns from failures
- **Optimization Tracking**: Monitors performance improvements
- **Adaptive Strategies**: Adjusts approach based on learning

### Memory System
```json
{
  "neural-memory": {
    "system-architect-patterns": [
      {
        "pattern": "microservices-design",
        "confidence": 0.92,
        "frequency": 47,
        "avgExecutionTime": 3200
      }
    ],
    "performance-optimizations": [
      {
        "technique": "database-indexing",
        "success_rate": 0.89,
        "impact_score": 8.5
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Performance Metrics

### Real-time Monitoring
- **Active Agents**: Current number of working agents
- **Task Completion Rate**: Success rate across all executions
- **Average Execution Time**: Performance tracking
- **Swarm Health**: Overall system health score
- **Neural Learning Progress**: Learning advancement metrics

### Health Assessment
```bash
smart-agents status
# ðŸ“Š Swarm Status:
# Active Agents: 12/25
# Health: 94%
# Neural Memory: 147 patterns
# Efficiency: 87%
# Learning Progress: Advanced
```

## SPARC Methodology Integration

The swarm integrates with the existing SPARC (Specification, Pseudocode, Architecture, Refinement, Completion) methodology:

1. **Specification Phase**: Requirements analysts and system architects collaborate
2. **Pseudocode Phase**: General-purpose and specialized agents create logical flows
3. **Architecture Phase**: System and backend architects design components
4. **Refinement Phase**: Quality engineers and specialists implement TDD
5. **Completion Phase**: DevOps architects handle integration and deployment

## Configuration

### Swarm Settings
```javascript
const swarmConfig = {
  maxAgents: 25,           // Maximum concurrent agents
  minAgents: 8,            // Minimum agent count
  learningEnabled: true,   // Neural learning active
  parallelMode: true,      // Parallel execution
  metricsInterval: 5000,   // Metrics collection interval
  healthThreshold: 70      // Health warning threshold
};
```

### Agent Specialization
```javascript
const agentConfig = {
  'system-architect': {
    priority: 9,
    complexity_threshold: 0.8,
    max_concurrent: 2
  },
  'performance-engineer': {
    priority: 8,
    complexity_threshold: 0.6,
    max_concurrent: 3
  }
  // ... more configurations
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Swarm not scaling**: Check workload analysis and complexity calculation
2. **Low efficiency**: Review task distribution and agent specialization
3. **Neural learning not improving**: Verify pattern recognition and memory storage
4. **High failure rate**: Analyze error patterns and adjust recovery mechanisms

### Debug Commands
```bash
# View detailed metrics
smart-agents metrics | jq '.learningPatterns'

# Check neural memory
cat .claude-flow/memory/neural-memory.json | jq '.["system-architect-patterns"]'

# Monitor real-time execution
tail -f .claude-flow/metrics/swarm-metrics.json
```
