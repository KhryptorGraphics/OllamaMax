# Pattern Learning - Extract Patterns from Successful Operations

Learn patterns from successful swarm operations to improve future performance through intelligent analysis and pattern extraction.

## Overview

The Pattern Learning system analyzes historical operation data to identify successful patterns that can be applied to future operations. It uses machine learning techniques to extract, validate, and categorize patterns across different aspects of swarm behavior.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Analysis** - Learn from swarm coordination, agent behavior, task execution, and communication
- **Configurable Thresholds** - Set success criteria for pattern extraction
- **Pattern Validation** - Statistical validation with confidence scoring
- **Pattern Categories** - Automatic categorization of discovered patterns
- **Save & Export** - Persistent storage and export capabilities
- **Implementation Guidance** - Actionable recommendations for applying patterns

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Make executable
chmod +x index.js

# Optional: Install globally
npm install -g .
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Learn from all successful operations
./index.js

# High success threshold with detailed analysis
./index.js --threshold 0.9 --analyze

## Implementation Guidance

### High-Confidence Patterns (90%+)
- **Ready for immediate implementation**
- Apply to similar operational contexts
- Monitor performance improvements
- Document results for future learning

### Medium-Confidence Patterns (70-89%)
- **Test in controlled environments first**
- Validate with additional data
- Gradual rollout recommended
- Monitor for unexpected effects

### Low-Confidence Patterns (50-69%)
- **Research and validation required**
- Collect more supporting data
- Consider as hypotheses for testing
- Use for exploratory improvements

## Quality Metrics

### Pattern Diversity
- **Broad (>2 categories)** - Comprehensive pattern coverage
- **Moderate (2 categories)** - Good pattern variety
- **Narrow (1 category)** - Limited pattern scope

### Validation Score
- **High (>80%)** - Statistically robust patterns
- **Medium (60-80%)** - Reasonably validated patterns
- **Low (<60%)** - Requires additional validation

## Integration

### Programmatic Usage
```javascript
const PatternLearnCLI = require('./index');

const cli = new PatternLearnCLI();
const result = await cli.run(['--source', 'communication', '--threshold', '0.9']);
```

### Claude Code Integration
```javascript
mcp__claude-flow__pattern_learn { 
  source: "all",
  threshold: 0.8,
  analyze: true
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Lower Thresholds** - Begin with 0.7-0.8 to discover initial patterns
2. **Focus on Specific Sources** - Use targeted analysis for specific improvements
3. **Regular Learning** - Run pattern learning periodically to capture new insights
4. **Validate Patterns** - Test patterns in controlled environments before full deployment
5. **Document Results** - Keep records of pattern implementation outcomes
6. **Iterative Improvement** - Use pattern results to inform future operations

## Troubleshooting

### No Patterns Discovered
- Lower the success threshold
- Increase the data collection period
- Check if operations are being logged correctly
- Try different pattern sources

### Low Confidence Patterns
- Increase sample size by collecting more data
- Verify operation success metrics are accurate
- Consider longer observation periods
- Check for data quality issues

### Pattern Implementation Failures
- Verify pattern conditions match current environment
- Check for configuration conflicts
- Ensure sufficient resources for pattern requirements
- Monitor for environmental changes
