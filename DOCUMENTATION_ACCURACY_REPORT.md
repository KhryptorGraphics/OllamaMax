## üéØ **Key Improvements Made**

### **1. Honest Feature Assessment**
**Before**: "Production-ready distributed AI serving 10,000+ requests/second"  
**After**: "Distributed framework with P2P networking and API compatibility (inference responses are placeholders)"

### **2. Accurate Command Documentation**  
**Before**: Referenced non-existent commands and flags  
**After**: Complete documentation of all working CLI commands with real examples

### **3. Real Configuration Options**
**Before**: Fictional configuration structure  
**After**: Exact configuration types from actual Go structs

### **4. Working Installation Process**
**Before**: Non-existent installation methods  
**After**: Actual build process and script usage

### **5. Proper API Documentation**
**Before**: Made-up API responses  
**After**: Actual endpoint responses from the codebase

## üìä **Implementation Status Overview**

### **‚úÖ Fully Working (90-100% Complete)**
- CLI Interface and Commands
- P2P Networking (libp2p)
- Configuration System  
- Basic API Endpoints
- Health Checks and Status
- Node Discovery and Communication

### **üöß Partially Working (30-70% Complete)**
- Distributed Model Management (framework exists, integration incomplete)
- Consensus Engine (Raft implementation present, needs database)
- Web Dashboard (basic structure, needs React components)
- Monitoring (Prometheus metrics basic only)

### **‚ùå Not Implemented (0-20% Complete)**
- Database Integration (package missing)
- Real Inference Distribution (placeholder responses only)
- Model Synchronization (P2P framework exists, sync logic incomplete)
- Production Authentication and Security
- Complete Web Interface

## üõ†Ô∏è **What Users Can Actually Do Now**

### **‚úÖ Working Use Cases**
1. **Development Testing**: Install and explore the distributed architecture
2. **CLI Interaction**: Use all documented CLI commands for setup and monitoring  
3. **Node Networking**: Connect multiple nodes via P2P
4. **API Testing**: Make API calls and receive structured (placeholder) responses
5. **Configuration**: Use configuration system and profiles
6. **System Monitoring**: Check cluster health and node status

### **üöß Limited/Placeholder Functionality**
1. **Model Operations**: Commands work but don't perform actual model operations
2. **Inference Requests**: API accepts requests but returns placeholder responses
3. **Web Interface**: Basic structure exists but limited functionality
4. **Database Operations**: Framework exists but database package missing
