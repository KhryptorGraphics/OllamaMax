# OllamaMax Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Testing Strategy Overview

**Objective**: Achieve >80% test coverage through systematic testing across 20 iterations
**Current State**: 53% test success rate with critical build failures
**Target State**: Production-ready test suite with full coverage

## Phase 7: 20 Iterations of Design Improvements & Testing

### Current Issues Analysis
1. **Build Failures**: Type redeclarations in pkg/p2p, pkg/distributed, pkg/loadbalancer
2. **Import Issues**: Unused imports preventing compilation
3. **Type Mismatches**: Inconsistent struct definitions across packages
4. **Security Test Failures**: XSS sanitization and encryption tests failing
5. **Coverage**: 0% statement coverage due to build failures

### Testing Categories & Targets

| Category | Current | Target | Priority |
|----------|---------|--------|----------|
| Unit Tests | Failed | 100% Pass | High |
| Integration Tests | Limited | 95% Pass | High |
| E2E Tests | Available | 90% Pass | Medium |
| Performance Tests | Limited | 85% Pass | Medium |
| Security Tests | 3 Failed | 100% Pass | Critical |
| Coverage | 0% | >80% | High |
