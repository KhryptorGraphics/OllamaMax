## Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path (8 weeks)
1. **Sprint C** → **Sprint D** → **Sprint E** → **Sprint F** → **Sprint H**
   - This path represents the minimum viable product to production
   - Any delay in this path delays the entire project
   - Total duration: 6 weeks

### Secondary Paths
1. **Documentation Path**: Sprint C → Sprint G
   - Can run in parallel with Sprint D
   - Non-blocking for production

2. **Quality Path**: Sprint D → Sprint E → Sprint H
   - Essential for production readiness
   - Cannot be shortened without risk

## Dependency Risk Matrix

### High Risk Dependencies
1. **Backend API Readiness** (Sprint C)
   - Impact: Blocks entire frontend development
   - Mitigation: Mock data, parallel development
   - Owner: Backend team

2. **DevOps Resource** (Sprint F)
   - Impact: Delays production deployment
   - Mitigation: Early knowledge transfer, documentation
   - Owner: Project manager

3. **Model Inference API** (Sprint D)
   - Impact: Blocks advanced features
   - Mitigation: Simulator, staged rollout
   - Owner: ML team

### Medium Risk Dependencies
1. **QA Resource** (Sprint E)
   - Impact: Reduced test coverage
   - Mitigation: Developer testing, automation
   - Owner: QA manager

2. **Technical Writer** (Sprint G)
   - Impact: Delayed documentation
   - Mitigation: Developer-written docs, templates
   - Owner: Documentation team

3. **GPU Resources** (Sprint D)
   - Impact: Limited testing capability
   - Mitigation: Cloud GPU rental, time-sharing
   - Owner: Infrastructure team

### Low Risk Dependencies
1. **Component Library** (Sprint C)
   - Impact: Minor UI inconsistencies
   - Mitigation: Already completed in Sprint B
   - Owner: Frontend team

2. **Monitoring Tools** (Sprint F)
   - Impact: Reduced observability
   - Mitigation: Open-source alternatives
   - Owner: DevOps team

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Can Run in Parallel
- Sprint G (Documentation) with Sprint D/E
- Parts of Sprint E (Testing) with late Sprint D
- Sprint H optimization with Sprint G documentation
- Infrastructure setup (Sprint F) can start during Sprint E

### Must Run Sequentially
- Sprint C → Sprint D (features need pages)
- Sprint E → Sprint F (testing before deployment)
- Sprint F → Sprint H (need production for optimization)

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Early Start**: Begin Sprint F infrastructure during Sprint E
2. **Parallel Tracks**: Documentation team starts during Sprint D
3. **Continuous Testing**: QA involvement from Sprint C
4. **Progressive Deployment**: Staged rollout during Sprint F

## Contingency Plans

### If Sprint C is Delayed
- Impact: 1-2 week overall delay
- Mitigation: 
  - Start Sprint D with mocked pages
  - Parallel development of independent features
  - Increase team size temporarily

### If Sprint E Finds Critical Issues
- Impact: 3-5 day delay
- Mitigation:
  - Hotfix team during Sprint F
  - Staged deployment strategy
  - Feature flags for problematic areas

### If Sprint F Deployment Fails
- Impact: 1 week delay minimum
- Mitigation:
  - Rollback plan ready
  - Blue-green deployment
  - Feature flags for gradual rollout

## Resource Leveling Strategy

### Week-by-Week Resource Allocation
| Week | Sprint | Developers | QA | DevOps | Writer |
|------|--------|-----------|-----|--------|--------|
| 1-2 | C | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 3-4 | D | 4 | 0.5 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | E | 2 | 1 | 0.5 | 0 |
| 6 | F | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| 7 | G | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 8 | H | 3 | 0 | 0.5 | 0 |
| 9 | I | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

### Resource Optimization
1. **Cross-training**: Developers learn DevOps basics
2. **Documentation**: Developers write initial docs
3. **Automation**: Reduce QA manual effort
4. **Pair Programming**: Knowledge sharing
5. **Part-time Allocation**: DevOps and Writers as needed
